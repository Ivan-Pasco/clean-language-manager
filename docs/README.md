## Key Concepts

### Version Management
The manager handles multiple compiler versions in isolated directories, allowing seamless switching between versions for different projects.

### Shim System
A lightweight proxy (`~/.cleanmanager/bin/cln`) that routes `cln` commands to the appropriate version based on global and project-specific settings.

### Project Integration
Project-specific versions are managed via `.cleanlanguage/.cleanversion` files that override global settings within project directories.

## Documentation Maintenance

### Updating Documentation
When modifying the codebase:
1. Update relevant documentation sections
2. Ensure examples remain accurate
3. Update command output samples if CLI changes
4. Verify cross-references between documents

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Keep diagrams and code samples up-to-date
