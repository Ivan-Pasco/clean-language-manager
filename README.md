#
# üõ£Ô∏è  Configuring PATH for Clean Language Manager
#
# Detected shell: zsh
# Configuration file: /Users/you/.zshrc
#
# Would you like to automatically add Clean Language Manager to your PATH? (Y/n): 
# ‚úÖ Successfully configured PATH!
#
# üîÑ To apply the changes:
#   1. Restart your terminal, OR
#   2. Run: source /Users/you/.zshrc

# Then run 'cleanmanager doctor' to verify your setup.
```

### Complete Setup
```bash
# Verify everything works
cleanmanager doctor

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

#### Unix/Linux/macOS
```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/Ivan-Pasco/clean-language-manager/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
iwr https://github.com/Ivan-Pasco/clean-language-manager/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Manual Installation

1. **Download** the appropriate binary for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/Ivan-Pasco/clean-language-manager/releases/latest):
   - **Linux (x86_64)**: `cleanmanager-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
   - **macOS (Intel)**: `cleanmanager-macos-x86_64.tar.gz`
   - **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `cleanmanager-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`
   - **Windows (x86_64)**: `cleanmanager-windows-x86_64.zip`

2. **Extract** the archive:
   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   tar -xzf cleanmanager-*.tar.gz
   
   # Windows
   # Extract using Windows Explorer or 7-Zip
   ```

3. **Move** the binary to a directory in your PATH:
   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   sudo mv cleanmanager /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Or to user directory
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   mv cleanmanager ~/.local/bin/
   ```

4. **Initialize** the environment:
   ```bash
   cleanmanager init
   ```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ivan-Pasco/clean-language-manager.git
cd clean-language-manager
cargo build --release
cp target/release/cleanmanager ~/.local/bin/  # or your preferred location
```

## Usage

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Set up your environment (adds cleanmanager to PATH)
cleanmanager init

# Verify everything is working
cleanmanager doctor
```

### Version Management
```bash
# Install a specific version
cleanmanager install 1.2.3

# List installed versions
cleanmanager list

# Switch to a version (makes it active)
cleanmanager use 1.2.3

# List available versions from GitHub
cleanmanager available

# Uninstall a version
cleanmanager uninstall 1.2.3
```

### Getting Help
```bash
# Show help for all commands
cleanmanager --help

# Show help for a specific command
cleanmanager install --help
```

## Architecture

The manager organizes versions in isolated directories:

```
~/.cleanmanager/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/cln                    # Shim to active version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ versions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.2.3/cln             # Version-specific binaries
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.3.0/cln
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json               # Manager configuration
```

## How It Works

Clean Language Manager stores different compiler versions in isolated directories and uses a shim system to route the `cln` command to the currently active version:

1. **Download**: Fetches compiler binaries from GitHub releases
2. **Install**: Extracts and stores each version in `~/.cleanmanager/versions/<version>/`
3. **Activate**: Creates a symlink/shim in `~/.cleanmanager/bin/cln` pointing to the active version
4. **Route**: When you run `cln`, it automatically uses the active version

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
If you get `command not found: cleanmanager`:
1. Make sure the binary is in your PATH: `echo $PATH`
2. Run `cleanmanager init` to get setup instructions
3. Restart your terminal after updating your shell configuration

### Clean Language Not Working
If `cln` doesn't work after installation:
1. Run `cleanmanager doctor` to diagnose issues
2. Make sure you've activated a version: `cleanmanager use <version>`
3. Check that `~/.cleanmanager/bin` is in your PATH

### Permission Issues
If you get permission errors:
- On Unix systems, make sure the binary is executable: `chmod +x cleanmanager`
- On Windows, you may need to run PowerShell as Administrator

## Development

See [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) for current implementation progress and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for development guidance.
